## Install Libraries
Youâ€™ll need to grab a couple of libraries to work with NeoPixels and BLE:

- Adafruit NeoPixel Library (to handle our shiny lights ðŸ’¡)
- ArduinoBLE Library (for Bluetooth communication)

Head to Tools > Manage Libraries and search for these to install them.

## Board selection

Use board > Seeed mbed-enabled > select the board; 
It needs to be the MBED enabled one!


## Uploading code to board

Connect to USB, then press reset button 2 times to go into bootloader mode.

It should now be visible in Arduino IDE under ports.
